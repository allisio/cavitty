## How?

`gem install cavitty`, then `cavitty -h` for usage.

## Why?

Folks like to show off their terminal color schemes in all sorts of ways. This is option *n + 1*. Also, [some](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cellular-automata/supplement.html) (but not most) of the elementary cellular automatons are just fun to watch evolve. This is best done on a terminal emulator that supports changing the font size on the fly, since zooming way out is usually necessary to get the full effect.
